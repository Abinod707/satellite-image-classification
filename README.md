# satellite-image-classification
This project focuses on automated classification of satellite images into distinct categories such as urban, water, vegetation, desert, or cloudy using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Satellite image classification plays a vital role in environmental monitoring, land use planning, disaster management, and agricultural mapping.
